sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: This was the slowest of the sorting algorithms, and there was a big difference between Big-O and Omega runtime.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Only two of the Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort and Selection sort) have Big-O and Omega about the same run time value,
and between the two it had the best time, for both reversed data(worst case) and sorted data(best case).
